For my project, I designed a simulation of a game in which the player advances by successfuly shooting a moving circular target.  The player avatar is a gun, which can be moved up with the 'w' key and down with the 's' key so as to aim at the target.  The player can fire a shot at the target by pressing the 'f' key.  Each time the player hits the target, a new level is generated with a target of different parameters.  This transition is marked by a randomized change in color of the game window.  Over time, the newly generated target parameters for each level are randomized using weights so as to favor targets of lower size and higher speed.  Given that these targets are harder to hit, the game is intended to become more difficult over time, though there are statistical exceptions due to the random factor.  I hope you enjoy the challenge!
